<p>A text based game for ICS 313.</p>

<p>You are an aspiring body builder that wishes to be the worlds swollest bro. Standing in your way is your gym’s boss. 
You need to out lift this monster if you wish to continue on your path to being the swollest bro. However, before challenging him, you need to be strong enough
and gather all the right equipment to defeat him. Journey through Gold’s gym and gather the protein shakes to gain strength as well as the proper equipment.</p>

<p>There are different rooms with various objects in them in which you can interact with. Ex: “There is a heavy box on the ground. Do you want to pick it up? Y or N”. However each action requires a certain amount of strength. You start off with 10 strength, and in order to gain more strength, you need to collect protein shakes around the map with each one giving you +10 strength. Below is a map of how the world will look.</p>
