;;;Description of tasks for project

For this project we created a GitHub repo that we can both update. 
I was in charge of updating the world (items, edges, macros, etc) and creating the description file. 
I added all of the locations into the world. I gave each world a description. 
I connected each location to each other by adding edges. Each location should be connected to at least one other location
I updated the items that are in the world. Players can pick up these items and collect them
I created a macro where the user can challenge the boss. 
This macro requires the user to have certain items and to be in a certain place
I created the description text file which included how the game works, how to operate the game, how to play the game, and tips on how to play.
